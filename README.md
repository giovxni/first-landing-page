# My First Landing Page

This is my first landing page, this is a challenge proposed my DIO.me in the first module of "CSS Web Developer", the challenge consist in replicate a landing page, using the knowledge acquired in the course, and previous knowledge.
I did some few improvements, using hover properties on buttons, changed the scrollbar to match with the page, and added some few anchors to make a real landing page.
